# Project Overview

This e-commerce case study analyzes six months of sales data to identify key business insights and trends. The dataset includes information such as order ID, date, product category, region, quantity sold, unit price, and total sales. The project focuses on visualizing and analyzing sales performance across different product categories, regions, and time periods to derive actionable insights for the business.

The goal of this project was to analyze the sales data of an e-commerce platform to provide actionable insights that can drive business growth. Specifically, we aimed to answer the following key questions:

   - Which regions generate the highest sales?

   - What are the top-selling product categories?

   - Are there any observable trends in sales over time (monthly)?

   - How do regional sales trends behave over time?

The analysis was conducted using Excel, BigQuery, R programming, and Power BI for visualization.
